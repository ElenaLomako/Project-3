## Introduction
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) hosts and collects information gathered across different energy sectors and jurisdictions to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets and public understanding of energy and its interactions with the economy and environment.

Using the [Sales (consumption), revenue, prices & customers annual dataset](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#sales), we aim to create a webpage containing interactive visualization elements to assist in the public understanding of electricity usage and price, and how these features change over time.
